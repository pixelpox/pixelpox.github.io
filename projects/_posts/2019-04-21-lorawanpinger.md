This is a simple electronics board that I picked up from one of the Sheffield Hackspace members. I ordered the components and soldered it all together.

Thankfully my novice soldering skills didn't kill the electronics and is working great. I currently have a hello world pinging program running on the arduino but will change it in the future to do something more fun.

I am also in love with this blue PCB finish.
