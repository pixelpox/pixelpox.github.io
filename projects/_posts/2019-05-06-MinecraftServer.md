While on holiday I decided to fill my time with as much computer related projects as possible. I spotted one of the [Sheffield Hackspace](https://www.sheffieldhackspace.org.uk/) members playing [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/) and thought it would be a great way for the members to socialize more.

Originally I wanted to just run a vanilla Minecraft server but there where a few challenges along the way. One of the issues was that the server could only handle 2 players at any time (not great for much socializing). So I had to order some more RAM to handle the resource usage.

The other issue that I ran into in was people griefing. I think this was more children who didn't understand that these creations belonged to other people. so I installed a [spigot server](https://www.spigotmc.org/) to replace the vanilla server. I then also installed the [griefprotection](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/griefprevention.1884/) plugin. This in itself had a learning curve to use and administrate.

If you would like to see some of the creations some people have made jump over to [Sheffield Hackspace - Minecraft](https://www.sheffieldhackspace.org.uk/minecraft-server/). If you would also like to join the server become a [digital member on the Sheffield Hackspace forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sheffield-hardware-hackers/categories) and ask for the details.
