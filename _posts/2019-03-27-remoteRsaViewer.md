I have been reviewing my keys that I carry and wanted to remove my RSA keyfob.

Keysmart and tile sold me a dream of a neat collection of keys.

## Mock up
-----

I came up with some designs on paper and mocked some of them up with carboard.

I abandoned the design of an angled holder as it didn't provide much space saving and also had the issue of not being very flexible.

The cardboard prototyping was very useful as I found out about the Raspberry Pi camera focus. The minimum distance from the camera to the RSA token was about 10cm.

## Fusion360
-----

Real reason why i was using it

## Laser cutting
-----

I went to the Sheffield Hackspace to use their laser cutter. Roughly Â£7 in materials and laser time I was given a load of acrylic parts to put together.

## Asembly
-----

Suprisingly fitted together 

## Software
-----

Currently it will just take a picture and publish it to the web. 

This apache server is only allowed to talk to local computers.



## Improvements
-----

Engrave distances on the slots

more of a gap to allow the power cord to be included in the box.
